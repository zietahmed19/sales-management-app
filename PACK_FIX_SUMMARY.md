# Pack Creation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The error `Pack created with ID: undefined` was caused by accessing the wrong property from the `promiseRun` result.

## Root Cause
- The `promiseRun` function returns `{ id: this.lastID, changes: this.changes }`
- The code was trying to access `result.lastID` instead of `result.id`
- From your logs: `Pack insertion result: { id: 6, changes: 1 }` clearly shows the ID is 6, but `result.lastID` was undefined

## Fix Applied
✅ **Changed `result.lastID` to `result.id`** in pack creation
✅ **Added gift_id parsing** to convert string to number (your request had `gift_id: '8'`)
✅ **Maintained all existing validation and logging**

## Expected Behavior Now
With your exact request data:
```javascript
{
  pack_name: 'Pack D',
  total_price: 200000,
  articles: [/* 2 articles */],
  gift_id: '8'
}
```

Should now work because:
1. Pack will be created with ID 6 (as shown in your logs)
2. `packId` will correctly be set to 6 (not undefined)
3. Articles will be inserted with pack_id = 6
4. Gift ID will be properly converted from string '8' to number 8

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy this fix** to Render.com
2. **Try creating the same pack again**
3. **Expected result**: Pack creation should succeed with proper article insertion

The core issue was a simple property access error - the database was working fine, we just weren't reading the returned ID correctly!
